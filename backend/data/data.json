Your position—that prevention should be prioritized over treatment—is consistent throughout the essay. Your arguments are relevant, extended, and well supported with examples and explanation. A slight improvement could be to provide a more concrete example (e.g., reference to a successful real-world program or statistics), which would strengthen the argument further."

Cohesive devices (e.g., “firstly,” “in contrast,” “this in turn,” “that said”) are used effectively and naturally. There is minor repetition in transition patterns (“firstly,” “secondly”)—varying your cohesive structures slightly could push it toward Band 9."

There’s some academic/formal tone which is fitting for IELTS. For a Band 9, you could add a few more sophisticated or idiomatic expressions to enhance lexical richness."

    "Essay": "In recent years, the rising costs of healthcare have sparked debate over whether governments should prioritize funding for preventive measures over curative treatments. While I acknowledge the necessity of treating individuals who are already ill, I strongly agree that investing public money in promoting healthy lifestyles is a more sustainable and effective approach in the long run.\n\nFirstly, prevention is more cost-effective than cure. Treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or obesity-related conditions often requires long-term medical care and expensive medications. In contrast, promoting healthier lifestyles through education, public campaigns, and community programs can reduce the incidence of these illnesses significantly. For example, initiatives that encourage physical activity, balanced diets, and smoking cessation can help prevent a wide range of preventable diseases, easing the burden on national healthcare systems.\n\nSecondly, promoting healthy lifestyles contributes to a higher quality of life. Individuals who engage in regular exercise, maintain proper nutrition, and avoid harmful habits like excessive drinking or smoking are more likely to enjoy better physical and mental well-being. Public health campaigns and school-based education programs can instill these habits early, leading to a healthier and more productive population. This, in turn, can have positive effects on the economy by reducing absenteeism and increasing overall workforce efficiency.\n\nThat said, it is important not to neglect those who are already suffering from illness. Healthcare systems must continue to provide timely and effective treatments, especially for patients with conditions that cannot be prevented through lifestyle changes alone. Emergency care, surgeries, and specialized treatments remain essential components of any comprehensive healthcare system.\n\nIn conclusion, while curative care is undeniably important, I firmly believe that governments should allocate more funding towards promoting healthy lifestyles. This proactive approach not only reduces long-term healthcare costs but also improves the overall well-being of society. A balanced strategy, where prevention is prioritized without compromising treatment, is the key to a healthier future."

    "Essay": "Public health funding has always sparked debate, especially when it comes to the allocation between prevention and treatment. Some argue that governments should prioritize promoting healthy lifestyles over treating existing diseases. I largely agree with this viewpoint, though I also recognize the necessity of maintaining strong treatment systems.\nPreventive healthcare — including lifestyle education, early screening, and public health campaigns — can dramatically reduce the incidence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. These are conditions that are often rooted in poor lifestyle choices, including unhealthy diets, lack of exercise, and smoking. By investing in public awareness and healthy behavior promotion, governments can lower the future burden on healthcare systems. For instance, the “5 A Day” fruit and vegetable campaign in the UK has been associated with improved dietary habits and long-term reductions in health risks. Such initiatives are cost-effective in the long run and support a healthier, more productive population.\nMoreover, prevention tends to be more equitable. Promoting healthy environments — such as smoke-free public spaces, clean air initiatives, and access to nutritious food — benefits the entire population regardless of socio-economic background. This contrasts with treatment-based systems, which may disproportionately favor those who can navigate healthcare infrastructure or afford private care.\nThat said, it would be shortsighted to neglect funding for treatment altogether. No matter how robust prevention efforts are, there will always be individuals who fall ill due to genetic conditions, accidents, or infectious diseases. For them, timely access to medical care is not a luxury but a necessity. A balanced healthcare system must ensure that hospitals, medical professionals, and emergency services are adequately resourced. Particularly in developing countries, treatment often remains the most immediate need due to limited health education or infrastructure.\nIn conclusion, while both prevention and treatment are essential components of a healthcare system, I believe public money should tilt more towards preventive measures. By addressing the root causes of illness and encouraging healthier lifestyles, governments can create long-term health improvements while reducing the strain on treatment services. The key lies in creating a sustainable balance — one that anticipates future health trends while caring for those in need today.\n"
