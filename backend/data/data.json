      "comment": "You address all parts of the question effectively and present a clear, well-developed opinion. Your position—that prevention should be prioritized over treatment—is consistent throughout the essay. Your arguments are relevant, extended, and well supported with examples and explanation. A slight improvement could be to provide a more concrete example (e.g., reference to a successful real-world program or statistics), which would strengthen the argument further."

      "comment": "The essay is logically organized, and ideas progress smoothly from one to the next. Paragraphing is clear and appropriate, with each paragraph focusing on a single main idea. Cohesive devices (e.g., “firstly,” “in contrast,” “this in turn,” “that said”) are used effectively and naturally. There is minor repetition in transition patterns (“firstly,” “secondly”)—varying your cohesive structures slightly could push it toward Band 9."

      "comment": "You demonstrate a strong range of vocabulary appropriate to the task: “chronic diseases,” “public campaigns,” “sustainable,” “productive population,” “allocate more funding.” Word choice is precise, and collocations are generally natural. There’s some academic/formal tone which is fitting for IELTS. For a Band 9, you could add a few more sophisticated or idiomatic expressions to enhance lexical richness."

      "comment": "This is a well-written, coherent, and thoughtful essay. With a bit more lexical and grammatical sophistication, and more vivid examples, it could reach 8.5 or even 9. Let me know if you’d like help with rewriting it to aim for Band 9."

    "Essay": "In recent years, the rising costs of healthcare have sparked debate over whether governments should prioritize funding for preventive measures over curative treatments. While I acknowledge the necessity of treating individuals who are already ill, I strongly agree that investing public money in promoting healthy lifestyles is a more sustainable and effective approach in the long run.\n\nFirstly, prevention is more cost-effective than cure. Treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or obesity-related conditions often requires long-term medical care and expensive medications. In contrast, promoting healthier lifestyles through education, public campaigns, and community programs can reduce the incidence of these illnesses significantly. For example, initiatives that encourage physical activity, balanced diets, and smoking cessation can help prevent a wide range of preventable diseases, easing the burden on national healthcare systems.\n\nSecondly, promoting healthy lifestyles contributes to a higher quality of life. Individuals who engage in regular exercise, maintain proper nutrition, and avoid harmful habits like excessive drinking or smoking are more likely to enjoy better physical and mental well-being. Public health campaigns and school-based education programs can instill these habits early, leading to a healthier and more productive population. This, in turn, can have positive effects on the economy by reducing absenteeism and increasing overall workforce efficiency.\n\nThat said, it is important not to neglect those who are already suffering from illness. Healthcare systems must continue to provide timely and effective treatments, especially for patients with conditions that cannot be prevented through lifestyle changes alone. Emergency care, surgeries, and specialized treatments remain essential components of any comprehensive healthcare system.\n\nIn conclusion, while curative care is undeniably important, I firmly believe that governments should allocate more funding towards promoting healthy lifestyles. This proactive approach not only reduces long-term healthcare costs but also improves the overall well-being of society. A balanced strategy, where prevention is prioritized without compromising treatment, is the key to a healthier future."
